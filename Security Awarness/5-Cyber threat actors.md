A cyber threat is the possibility of a malicious attempt to damage or disrupt a computer network or system. Cyber threat actors are individuals or groups of people who maliciously aim to take advantage of system security weaknesses to compromise and gain unauthorized access to victim data, computers, or networks.

The motivation of threat actors may vary and can be categorized into different groups:

- Nation-state cyber threat actors are geopolitically motivated.
- Cybercriminals are financially motivated.
- Hacktivists are ideologically motivated.
- Terrorist groups are motivated by ideological violence.
- Thrill-seekers are motivated by satisfaction.
- Insider threat actors are motivated by discontent.
